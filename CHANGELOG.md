## [0.5.32] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Worker self-onboarding wizard** — new workers see a 3-step setup modal on first login instead of landing on a blank dashboard
  - Step 1 "Profile": name (required to advance), email, phone
  - Step 2 "Work & Pay": default hourly rate, ABN
  - Step 3 "Invoicing": bank name, BSB, account number
  - Completed steps show a tick; "Skip for now" link available on every step
  - Only shown to workers (`role = user`) who have no name set and haven't previously completed onboarding; existing users are unaffected
  - `components/OnboardingWizard.tsx` — new self-contained wizard component
  - `hooks/useAppData.ts` — `showOnboarding` flag + `handleCompleteOnboarding` (merges wizard fields into settings and sets `onboardingCompleted: true`)
  - `types/index.ts` — `onboardingCompleted?: boolean` added to `Settings`

---

## [0.5.31] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Admin CSV export** — "Export CSV" button in the admin Dashboard Users summary card downloads a single file containing two sections: a per-worker summary (hours, TFN/ABN/OT split, earnings) and a full detailed entries list; filename includes the active period dates
  - `components/Dashboard.tsx` — `downloadAdminCSV` helper builds and triggers the download client-side (no API); `periodStart` / `periodEnd` added as optional props
  - `components/WorkHoursTracker.tsx` — passes `periodStart` and `periodEnd` to `Dashboard`

---

## [0.5.30] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **GST registration toggle** — contractors registered for GST can now enable it in Settings → Personal; ABN invoices (live and saved) will display a GST (10%) line and the correct GST-inclusive total
  - `components/SettingsPage.tsx` — "Registered for GST" checkbox in the Personal tab below the ABN field
  - `components/ABNInvoice.tsx` — computes `gst = subtotal × 0.1` when `gstRegistered`; invoice shows Subtotal / GST / Total; label reads "GST (N/A)" when not registered
  - `components/InvoiceHistory.tsx` — saved invoice viewer applies the same logic using the snapshot settings; invoice list row also shows the GST-inclusive total
  - `types/index.ts` — `gstRegistered?: boolean` added to `Settings`

---

## [0.5.29] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Earnings trend chart** — plain-SVG bar chart on the Dashboard showing earnings grouped by week or month; no external library added
  - Worker view: stacked bars with TFN (green) at the bottom and ABN (blue) on top, with a legend; compact value labels above each bar
  - Admin view: single-colour bars showing combined team earnings per period
  - Weekly / Monthly toggle in the chart header; chart scrolls horizontally when there are many bars
  - `components/EarningsChart.tsx` — new self-contained chart component; receives `processed: ProcessedEntry[]` and `isAdmin?: boolean`
  - `components/Dashboard.tsx` — chart rendered after the metrics grids in both worker and admin layouts

---

## [0.5.28] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **In-app logging reminder** — a dismissable banner appears between the tab bar and main content when the user hasn't logged hours for a configurable number of days; includes a "Log now" shortcut that navigates directly to the Log Entry tab
  - `hooks/useAppData.ts` — `showReminder` / `reminderDaysSince` computed via `useMemo`; `dismissReminder` callback; `reminderDismissed` per-session state
  - `components/WorkHoursTracker.tsx` — reminder banner rendered between nav and main content; only shown to non-admin users
  - `components/SettingsPage.tsx` — "Logging reminder" control in the Personal tab: enable/disable toggle + configurable day threshold (default 2 days)
  - `types/index.ts` — `reminderEnabled?: boolean` and `reminderDays?: number` added to `Settings`

---

## [0.5.27] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- `TFNReport.tsx` — Client column now appears when any TFN entry has a client tag; shows `—` for entries without one
- `ABNInvoice.tsx` — client name rendered as a sub-line below the job description in each invoice row
- `InvoiceHistory.tsx` — same client sub-line shown in saved invoice viewers (applies to invoices advanced from this version onward)
- `hooks/useAppData.ts` — `advanceInvoice` now includes `client` on each saved `InvLineRow` so the history viewer can display it
- `types/index.ts` — `InvLineRow` gains `client?: string`

---

## [0.5.26] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Entry templates** — save common work entries as reusable one-click templates
  - `LogEntry.tsx` — "Quick fill" chip bar above the form when templates exist; clicking a chip prefills job description, client, rate, and start/end times; "Save as template" secondary button captures the current form fields
  - `SettingsPage.tsx` — "Saved templates" list at the bottom of the Personal tab showing all templates with delete buttons; deletions are persisted on "Save Settings"
  - `hooks/useAppData.ts` — `handleSaveTemplate` callback stores templates inside the existing `settings` JSONB column (no DB migration required)
  - `types/index.ts` — `EntryTemplate` interface added; `templates?: EntryTemplate[]` added to `Settings`

---

## [0.5.25] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Client / Project tagging** — every entry can now be tagged with an optional client or project name
  - `LogEntry.tsx` — new "Client / Project (optional)" input with `datalist` autocomplete from previously used client names
  - `AdminEditModal.tsx` — same field added to the admin edit overlay
  - `EntriesList.tsx` — Client column (shown only when at least one entry has a client); client filter dropdown alongside the existing user filter; filter combines additively with user filter
  - `WeeklyReport.tsx` — client name shown as a sub-line (with building icon) below the job description in expanded day rows
  - `hooks/useAppData.ts` — `clients` list derived via `useMemo` and threaded through to all relevant components
  - `services/entries.ts` — `client` field round-tripped through `rowToEntry` / `entryToRow`
  - `types/index.ts` — `client?: string` added to `Entry`; `client: string` added to `FormState`
  - `supabase/migrations/011_entries_client.sql` — `client text` column added to the `entries` table

---

## [0.5.24] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- `components/ABNInvoice.tsx` — `addItem()` now shows a specific inline error message (with `ti-alert-circle` icon) when a field is invalid instead of silently doing nothing; errors clear automatically when the user edits any field
- `addItem()` validation bug fixed: negative amounts previously passed the `!amt` check; replaced with `isNaN(amt) || amt <= 0`

---

## [0.5.23] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- `components/EntriesList.tsx` — delete button now disables itself and swaps to a loader icon (`ti-loader-2`) while the async delete is in-flight, preventing double-clicks; button restores on completion or error via `try/finally`
- `app/globals.css` — added `.icon-btn-sm:disabled` rule (`opacity: 0.45; cursor: not-allowed; pointer-events: none`)

---

## [0.5.22] - 2026-05-16

### Changed
- `services/entries.ts` — `deleteEntry` now soft-deletes by setting `deleted_at = now()` instead of issuing a hard `DELETE`; `getEntries` and `getAdminEntries` filter `deleted_at IS NULL` so deleted rows are never returned to the UI
- `supabase/migrations/010_entries_soft_delete.sql` — adds `deleted_at timestamptz` column; replaces the plain `entries_user_id_date_idx` from migration 009 with a partial index `entries_active_user_date_idx (user_id, date, start_time) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`, which indexes only live rows

---

## [0.5.21] - 2026-05-16

### Performance
- `components/Dashboard.tsx` — `byDate`/`dates` grouping and `userStats` aggregation are now wrapped in `useMemo` keyed on `[processed]` (and `[processed, users, isAdmin]` for the admin table); previously both loops re-ran on every render even when `settings` or `totals` changed but `processed` had not. `userStats` was also hoisted above the early-return branch to comply with the Rules of Hooks.

---

## [0.5.20] - 2026-05-16

### Performance
- `supabase/migrations/009_indexes.sql` — three composite indexes:
  - `entries(user_id, date, start_time)` — covers both `getEntries` (single user) and `getAdminEntries` (IN list) which filter by `user_id` and sort by `date`/`start_time`
  - `invoices(user_id, invoice_num DESC)` — covers `getInvoices` filter + descending sort in one index scan
  - `profiles(admin_id, role)` — covers `getManagedTeam`, `getManagedUsers`, and `getManagedAdmins` which filter `admin_id = X AND role = 'user'|'admin'`

---

## [0.5.19] - 2026-05-16

### Performance
- `services/invoices.ts` — `getInvoices` now applies `.limit(50)` so the query returns at most the 50 most recent invoices (sorted by `invoice_num` descending); previously the query was unbounded and would return every invoice ever saved

---

## [0.5.18] - 2026-05-16

### Performance
- `hooks/useAppData.ts` — wrapped all handler and helper functions with `useCallback`: `showToast`, `saveEntry`, `removeEntry`, `saveSettings`, `signOut`, `toggleTheme`, `updatePeriod`, `handleSave`, `handleEdit`, `handleAdminSave`, `handleAdminClose` (new — extracted from inline JSX), `handleDelete`, `handleSettingsSave`, `handleSaveWorkerRules`, `handleInvite`, `advanceInvoice`, `handleCancelEdit`, `handleDeleteInvoice`, `updateInvoiceItems` (extracted from return object). Stable callback references let the `React.memo` wrappers from v0.5.17 actually skip re-renders — previously every render produced new function references that defeated memo equality checks
- `components/WorkHoursTracker.tsx` — replaced the inline `() => setAdminEditEntry(null)` on `AdminEditModal.onClose` with the stable `handleAdminClose` callback

---

## [0.5.17] - 2026-05-16

### Performance
- Wrapped all tab-panel components and `ui.tsx` primitives with `React.memo`: `Dashboard`, `LogEntry`, `EntriesList`, `WeeklyReport`, `TFNReport`, `ABNInvoice`, `InvoiceHistory`, `AdminEditModal`, `SettingsPage`, `Metric`, `Bdg` — components now bail out of re-rendering when their props have not changed (e.g., when a toast appears/disappears or the admin modal opens while the active tab's data is unchanged)

---

## [0.5.16] - 2026-05-16

### Performance
- `hooks/useAppData.ts` admin init — replaced two sequential calls (`getManagedUsers` then `getManagedAdmins`, each triggering a separate `resolveRootAdminId` round-trip) with a single `getManagedTeam` call; `getManagedTeam` resolves the root admin ID once and fetches workers and co-admins in parallel. `getSettings` runs concurrently in the same batch, cutting admin startup from 3 sequential round-trips to 2.

---

## [0.5.15] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- `components/AdminEditModal.tsx` — `breakMins` clamped to `Math.max(0, ...)` so negative values cannot reach the calculation engine or DB; `hourlyRate` is now validated with `isNaN` + `< 0` guard before `onSave` is called, consistent with the same fix applied to `handleSave` in v0.5.11

---

## [0.5.14] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- `handleDeleteInvoice` in `hooks/useAppData.ts` — DB result is now checked before updating UI state; a failed delete no longer silently removes the invoice from the list and shows a success toast

---

## [0.5.13] - 2026-05-16

### Security
- `supabase/migrations/008_profiles_email_unique.sql` — added a partial unique index on `profiles.email` (where email is not null); previously the same address could be invited multiple times, creating duplicate or orphaned auth users

---

## [0.5.12] - 2026-05-16

### Security
- `app/api/invite/route.ts` — email address is now trimmed and lowercased before being passed to `inviteUserByEmail`; trailing spaces or mixed-case addresses previously created duplicate accounts

---

## [0.5.11] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- `handleSave` in `hooks/useAppData.ts` — `hourlyRate` is now parsed and validated before building the entry: non-numeric strings (e.g. "abc") that previously passed the truthy check and stored NaN to the DB now show an error toast instead; `breakMins` is clamped to `Math.max(0, ...)` so negative values from a crafted request cannot reach the calculation engine

---

## [0.5.10] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- `handleSave` in `hooks/useAppData.ts` — DB write is now awaited before updating UI state and showing a success toast; silently-failed saves no longer mark an entry as saved on screen
- `handleAdminSave` in `hooks/useAppData.ts` — same fix: the modal now stays open and shows an error toast if the DB upsert fails, instead of closing and toasting success unconditionally
- `handleDelete` in `hooks/useAppData.ts` — entry is only removed from UI state after the DB delete confirms success; previously the list updated immediately and the error (if any) was invisible

### Security
- `supabase/migrations/007_profiles_managed_select.sql` — replaced the hardcoded `admin_id = auth.uid()` check on `profiles_managed_select` with `manages_user(user_id)`, so sub-admins can now read the profiles of workers they manage (the entries/settings policies already used `manages_user`; the profiles policy was the only one left behind)
- `app/auth/confirm/route.ts` — closed open-redirect: the `?next=` query param is now validated to be a relative path before use; absolute URLs, protocol-relative URLs (`//attacker.com`), and `javascript:` URIs all fall back to `/`

---

## [0.5.6] - 2026-05-16

### Security
- `genId()` in `lib/formatters.ts` now uses `crypto.randomUUID()` instead of `Date.now().toString(36) + Math.random()` — UUIDs are cryptographically random and unguessable, whereas the old scheme was predictable from wall-clock time
- Added HTTP security headers in `next.config.ts` applied to all routes: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy` (camera, microphone, geolocation off)

---

## [0.5.5] - 2026-05-16

### Performance
- Derived values (`processed`, `weeklyData`, `totals`, `tfnPct`, `allPeriodEntries`) in `hooks/useAppData.ts` are now wrapped in `useMemo` keyed on `[entries, periodStart, periodEnd, settings.tfnLimit, settings.tfnRate, settings.overtimeThreshold]` — `processEntries` no longer re-runs on every form keystroke or `editId` change
- `TABS` array is now memoised on `[userRole]` — the tab definition object is stable across renders
- Supabase client moved from a bare `createClient()` call (re-executed on every render) to `useRef(createClient())` — the client is now created once per mount

---

## [0.5.4] - 2026-05-16

### Security
- `upsertEntry` in `services/entries.ts` now always writes to the explicitly passed `userId` — previously it fell back to `entry.ownerId`, allowing the call site to silently route writes to any user's row
- `handleAdminSave` in `hooks/useAppData.ts` now explicitly passes `updated.ownerId` as the target user ID when saving an admin-edited entry, making the intent clear at the call site rather than relying on a hidden fallback in the service layer

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-05-16

### Security
- Enabled RLS on the `settings` table and added user-ownership policies (`settings_own_select/insert/update/delete`) — without these, any authenticated user could read or modify any other user's settings (`supabase/migrations/003_settings_invoices_rls.sql`)
- Enabled RLS on the `invoices` table and added user-ownership policies (`invoices_own_select/insert/update/delete`) — without these, any authenticated user could read or delete any other user's invoice history

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-16

### Security
- Added explicit user-level RLS policies on the `entries` table (`entries_own_select`, `entries_own_insert`, `entries_own_update`, `entries_own_delete`) — the previous migration referenced these policies without defining them (`supabase/migrations/002_entries_rls.sql`)

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- Removed unused default Next.js SVGs from `public/` (`file.svg`, `globe.svg`, `next.svg`, `vercel.svg`, `window.svg`)
- Rewrote `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the current architecture (hooks, services, split components, proxy middleware, user roles)

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-14

### Security
- Added `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 middleware) — unauthenticated requests are now redirected to `/login` server-side before any client JS runs, eliminating the loading-screen flash for unauthenticated users
- Added `lib/supabase-server.ts` — server-side Supabase client using `next/headers` cookies, ready for Server Components and Route Handlers

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed (internal refactor — no user-facing changes)
- Extracted all TypeScript interfaces to `types/index.ts`
- Extracted calculation engine (`calcHours`, `processEntries`, `MIN_HOURS`) to `lib/calculations.ts`
- Extracted display helpers (`fh`, `fc`, `fd`, `fdInv`, `todayStr`, `genId`, `buildPdfFilename`, `downloadPdf`) to `lib/formatters.ts`
- Extracted all Supabase queries to `services/` (`entries.ts`, `settings.ts`, `profiles.ts`, `invoices.ts`)
- Extracted all app state, effects, and handlers to `hooks/useAppData.ts`
- Split `components/WorkHoursTracker.tsx` (1 818 lines) into 10 focused component files: `Dashboard`, `LogEntry`, `EntriesList`, `WeeklyReport`, `TFNReport`, `ABNInvoice`, `InvoiceHistory`, `AdminEditModal`, `SettingsPage`, `ui` (Metric + Bdg)
- `WorkHoursTracker.tsx` reduced to a 120-line pure rendering shell

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Admin role system: admins see a combined view of all managed workers' entries; workers are linked to an admin via `admin_id` in the `profiles` table
- `supabase/migrations/001_admin.sql` — `profiles` table, security-definer helpers (`is_admin`, `manages_user`), RLS policies for profiles and admin entry access, signup trigger, back-fill for existing users
- Admin dashboard: users summary table (hours + earnings per worker) and recent-days breakdown
- `AdminEditModal` — overlay form allowing admins to edit any managed worker's entry
- Entries tab user filter for admin view
- Admin-specific tab set (no Log Entry, TFN Report, or ABN Invoice tabs)

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- All entry lists (Dashboard, Entries, ABN Invoice) now sort by date then start time
- Weekly report now shows all entries across all weeks, not just the current week
- Weekly report TFN/ABN hours and earnings were incorrect when archived entries had consumed part of the TFN budget — fixed by merging active-entry processed values over the all-entries baseline (`weeklyData` merge pattern)
- ABN invoice line items now sort by date then start time

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Initial project: Next.js 16, Supabase Auth, Tailwind CSS
- Work entry logging (date, job description, start/end time, hourly rate, break minutes)
- Calculation engine: TFN/ABN split with configurable hour limit, overtime at ×1.5 above configurable daily threshold, 4-hour minimum call
- Dashboard with metrics grid (total hours, TFN/ABN hours, overtime, earnings)
- Entries list with edit and delete
- Weekly report with expandable per-entry rows and PDF download
- TFN timesheet report (printable)
- ABN tax invoice with extra line-item manager and PDF download
- Invoice history with saved invoice viewer and PDF re-download
- Settings (personal info, company info, work rules, payment details, PDF filename pattern)
- Light/dark theme toggle with system preference detection
- Supabase-backed persistence (entries, settings, invoices tables)
- Login page via Supabase Auth UI
